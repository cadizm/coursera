### Model Representation

a(j) sub i = activation of unit i in layer j

theta(j) = matrix of weights controlling function mapping
           from layer j to layer j + 1

More generally, if a network has s sub j units in layer j,
s sub (j+1) units in layer j + 1, then theta(j) will be of
dimension: s sub (j+1) x s sub (j) + 1.

theta(layer 1) = num units in layer (1+1) x num units in layer(1) + 1

theta(1) = s sub (2) x s sub (1) + 1
         = 4 x 2+1
         = 4 x 3

Forward propagation computation. Can vectorize.
