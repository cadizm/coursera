Application Example: Photo OCR
==============================

Photo optical character recognition.

Pipeline
    1. text detection
    2. character sgementation
    3. character classification


### Sliding Windows Classifier

Example: supervised learning for pedestrian detection

Get training examples with both positive and negative examples.

After training classifier, take patch, run through classifier, then slide,
and then repeat.

Step size of 1 pixel is best, more obviously more computationally expensive.

Then take larger image patch and run through classifier again.


### Getting Lots of Data: Artificial Data Synthesis


### Ceiling Analysis: What Part of the Pipeline to Work on Next

Ceiling analysis
    For each component measure accuracy
